     * It's safe to modify the wallet from inside this callback, but if you're replaying the block chain you should
     * be careful to avoid such modifications. Otherwise your changes may be overridden by new data from the chain.

     * @param wallet       The wallet object that this callback relates to (that sent the coins).
     * @param tx           The transaction that sent the coins to someone else.
     * @param prevBalance  The wallets balance before this transaction was seen.
     * @param newBalance   The wallets balance after this transaction was seen. This is the 'estimated' balance.
