/**
 * PrunedException is thrown in cases where a fully verifying node has deleted (pruned) old block data that turned
 * out to be necessary for handling a re-org. Normally this should never happen unless you're playing with the testnet
 * as the pruning parameters should be set very conservatively, such that an absolutely enormous re-org would be
 * required to trigger it.
