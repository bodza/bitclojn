;;;
 ; <p>An AbstractBlockChain holds a series of {@link Block} objects, links them together, and knows how to verify that
 ; the chain follows the rules of the {@link NetworkParameters} for this chain.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>It can be connected to a {@link Wallet}, and also {@link TransactionReceivedInBlockListener}s that can receive
 ; transactions and notifications of re-organizations.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>An AbstractBlockChain implementation must be connected to a {@link BlockStore} implementation.  The chain object
 ; by itself doesn't store any data, that's delegated to the store.  Which store you use is a decision best made by
 ; reading the getting started guide, but briefly, fully validating block chains need fully validating stores.  In
 ; the lightweight SPV mode, a {@link org.bitcoinj.store.SPVBlockStore} is the right choice.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>This class implements an abstract class which makes it simple to create a BlockChain that does/doesn't do
 ; full verification.  It verifies headers and is implements most of what is required to implement SPV mode, but
 ; also provides callback hooks which can be used to do full verification.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>There are two subclasses of AbstractBlockChain that are useful: {@link BlockChain}, which is the simplest
 ; class and implements <i>simplified payment verification</i>.  This is a lightweight and efficient mode that
 ; does not verify the contents of blocks, just their headers.  A {@link FullPrunedBlockChain} paired with a
 ; {@link org.bitcoinj.store.H2FullPrunedBlockStore} implements full verification, which is equivalent to
 ; Bitcoin Core.  To learn more about the alternative security models, please consult the articles on the
 ; website.</p>
 ;
 ; <b>Theory</b>
 ;
 ; <p>The 'chain' is actually a tree although in normal operation it operates mostly as a list of {@link Block}s.
 ; When multiple new head blocks are found simultaneously, there are multiple stories of the economy competing to become
 ; the one true consensus.  This can happen naturally when two miners solve a block within a few seconds of each other,
 ; or it can happen when the chain is under attack.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>A reference to the head block of the best known chain is stored.  If you can reach the genesis block by repeatedly
 ; walking through the prevBlock pointers, then we say this is a full chain.  If you cannot reach the genesis block
 ; we say it is an orphan chain.  Orphan chains can occur when blocks are solved and received during the initial block
 ; chain download, or if we connect to a peer that doesn't send us blocks in order.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>A reorganize occurs when the blocks that make up the best known chain changes.  Note that simply adding a
 ; new block to the top of the best chain isn't as reorganize, but that a reorganize is always triggered by adding
 ; a new block that connects to some other (non best head) block.  By "best" we mean the chain representing the largest
 ; amount of work done.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>Every so often the block chain passes a difficulty transition point.  At that time, all the blocks in the last
 ; 2016 blocks are examined and a new difficulty target is calculated from them.</p>

    (:import [java.util Date HashSet Set]))

;;;
 ; Alerts are signed messages that are broadcast on the peer-to-peer network if they match a hard-coded signing key.
 ; The private keys are held by a small group of core Bitcoin developers, and alerts may be broadcast in the event of
 ; an available upgrade or a serious network problem.  Alerts have an expiration time, data that specifies what
 ; set of software versions it matches and the ability to cancel them by broadcasting another type of alert.
 ;
 ; The right course of action on receiving an alert is usually to either ensure a human will see it (display on screen,
 ; log, email), or if you decide to use alerts for notifications that are specific to your app in some way, to parse it.
 ; For example, you could treat it as an upgrade notification specific to your app.  Satoshi designed alerts to ensure
 ; that software upgrades could be distributed independently of a hard-coded website, in order to allow everything to
 ; be purely peer-to-peer.  You don't have to use this of course, and indeed it often makes more sense not to.
 ;
 ; <p>Before doing anything with an alert, you should check {@link AlertMessage#isSignatureValid()}.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple threads.</p>

    (:import [java.math BigInteger]

;;;
 ; Base58 is a way to encode Bitcoin addresses (or arbitrary data) as alphanumeric strings.
 ;
 ; Note that this is not the same base58 as used by Flickr, which you may find referenced around the Internet.
 ;
 ; You may want to consider working with {@link VersionedChecksummedBytes} instead, which
 ; adds support for testing the prefix and suffix bytes commonly found in addresses.
 ;
 ; Satoshi explains: why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?
 ; <ul>
 ; <li>Don't want 0OIl characters that look the same in some fonts and
 ;     could be used to create visually identical looking account numbers.</li>
 ; <li>A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as an account number.</li>
 ; <li>E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break at.</li>
 ; <li>Doubleclicking selects the whole number as one word if it's all alphanumeric.</li>
 ; </ul>
 ;
 ; However, note that the encoding/decoding runs in O(n&sup2;) time, so it is not useful for large data.
 ;
 ; The basic idea of the encoding is to treat the data bytes as a large number represented using
 ; base-256 digits, convert the number to be represented using base-58 digits, preserve the exact
 ; number of leading zeros (which are otherwise lost during the mathematical operations on the
 ; numbers), and finally represent the resulting base-58 digits as alphanumeric ASCII characters.

 ; <p>A block is a group of transactions, and is one of the fundamental data structures of the Bitcoin system.
 ; It records a set of {@link Transaction}s together with some data that links it into a place in the global block chain,
 ; and proves that a difficult calculation was done over its contents.
 ; See <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">the Bitcoin technical paper</a> for more detail on blocks.
 ;
 ; <p>To get a block, you can either build one from the raw bytes you can get from another implementation, or request one
 ; specifically using {@link Peer#getBlock(Sha256Hash)}, or grab one from a downloaded {@link BlockChain}.</p>

 ; <p>Vends hard-coded {@link StoredBlock}s for blocks throughout the chain.  Checkpoints serve two purposes:</p>
 ; <ol>
 ;    <li>They act as a safety mechanism against huge re-orgs that could rewrite large chunks of history, thus
 ;    constraining the block chain to be a consensus mechanism only for recent parts of the timeline.</li>
 ;    <li>They allow synchronization to the head of the chain for new wallets/users much faster than syncing all
 ;    headers from the genesis block.</li>
 ; </ol>
 ;
 ; <p>Checkpoints are used by the SPV {@link BlockChain} to initialize fresh {@link org.bitcoinj.store.SPVBlockStore}s.
 ; They are not used by fully validating mode, which instead has a different concept of checkpoints that are used
 ; to hard-code the validity of blocks that violate BIP30 (duplicate coinbase transactions).
 ; Those "checkpoints" can be found in NetworkParameters.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>The file format consists of the string "CHECKPOINTS 1", followed by a uint32 containing the number of signatures
 ; to read.  The value may not be larger than 256 (so it could have been a byte but isn't for historical reasons).
 ; If the number of signatures is larger than zero, each 65 byte ECDSA secp256k1 signature then follows.  The signatures
 ; sign the hash of all bytes that follow the last signature.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>After the signatures come an int32 containing the number of checkpoints in the file.  Then each checkpoint follows
 ; one after the other.  A checkpoint is 12 bytes for the total work done field, 4 bytes for the height, 80 bytes
 ; for the block header and then 1 zero byte at the end (i.e. number of transactions in the block: always zero).</p>

 ; work as a Context will be created for you and stashed in thread local storage.  The context is then propagated between
 ; library created threads as needed.  This automagical propagation and creation is a temporary mechanism: one day it
 ; will be removed to avoid confusing edge cases that could occur if the developer does not fully understand it e.g.
 ; in the case where multiple instances of the library are in use simultaneously.</p>

;;;
 ; <p>Represents an elliptic curve public and (optionally) private key, usable for digital signatures but not encryption.
 ; Creating a new ECKey with the empty constructor will generate a new random keypair.  Other static methods can be used
 ; when you already have the public or private parts.  If you create a key with only the public part, you can check
 ; signatures but not create them.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>ECKey also provides access to Bitcoin Core compatible text message signing, as accessible via the UI or JSON-RPC.
 ; This is slightly different to signing raw bytes - if you want to sign your own data and it won't be exposed as
 ; text to people, you don't want to use this.  If in doubt, ask on the mailing list.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>The ECDSA algorithm supports <i>key recovery</i> in which a signature plus a couple of discriminator bits can
 ; be reversed to find the public key used to calculate it.  This can be convenient when you have a message and a
 ; signature and want to find out who signed it, rather than requiring the user to provide the expected identity.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>This class supports a variety of serialization forms.  The methods that accept/return byte arrays serialize
 ; private keys as raw byte arrays and public keys using the SEC standard byte encoding for public keys.  Signatures
 ; are encoded using ASN.1/DER inside the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>A key can be <i>compressed</i> or <i>uncompressed</i>.  This refers to whether the public key is represented
 ; when encoded into bytes as an (x, y) coordinate on the elliptic curve, or whether it's represented as just an X
 ; co-ordinate and an extra byte that carries a sign bit.  With the latter form the Y coordinate can be calculated
 ; dynamically, however, <b>because the binary serialization is different the address of a key changes if its
 ; compression status is changed</b>.  If you deviate from the defaults it's important to understand this: money sent
 ; to a compressed version of the key will have a different address to the same key in uncompressed form.  Whether
 ; a public key is compressed or not is recorded in the SEC binary serialisation format, and preserved in a flag in
 ; this class so round-tripping preserves state.  Unless you're working with old software or doing unusual things, you
 ; can usually ignore the compressed/uncompressed distinction.</p>

 ; <p>A data structure that contains proofs of block inclusion for one or more transactions, in an efficient manner.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>The encoding works as follows: we traverse the tree in depth-first order, storing a bit for each traversed node,
 ; signifying whether the node is the parent of at least one matched leaf txid (or a matched txid itself).  In case we
 ; are at the leaf level, or this bit is 0, its merkle node hash is stored, and its children are not explored further.
 ; Otherwise, no hash is stored, but we recurse into both (or the only) child branch.  During decoding, the same
 ; depth-first traversal is performed, consuming bits and hashes as they were written during encoding.</p>

        ;; The block chain download process is a bit complicated.  Basically, we start with one or more blocks in a

        ;; where that chain is up to or even if the top block we have is even still in the chain - we
        ;; might have got ourselves onto a fork that was later resolved by the network.
        ;;
        ;; To solve this, we send the peer a block locator which is just a list of block hashes.  It contains the
        ;; blocks we know about, but not all of them, just enough of them so the peer can figure out if we did end up
        ;; on a fork and if so, what the earliest still valid block we know about is likely to be.
        ;;
        ;; Once it has decided which blocks we need, it will send us an inv with up to 500 block messages.  We may
        ;; have some of them already if we already have a block chain and just need to catch up.  Once we request the
        ;; last block, if there are still more to come it sends us an "inv" containing only the hash of the head
        ;; block.
        ;;
        ;; That causes us to download the head block but then we find (in processBlock) that we can't connect
        ;; it to the chain yet because we don't have the intermediate blocks.  So we rerun this function building a
        ;; new block locator describing where we're up to.
        ;;
        ;; The getblocks with the new locator gets us another inv with another bunch of blocks.  We download them once
        ;; again.  This time when the peer sends us an inv with the head block, we already have it so we won't download
        ;; it again - but we recognize this case as special and call back into blockChainDownloadLocked to continue the
        ;; process.
        ;;
        ;; So this is a complicated process but it has the advantage that we can download a chain of enormous length
        ;; in a relatively stateless manner and with constant memory usage.
        ;;
        ;; All this is made more complicated by the desire to skip downloading the bodies of blocks that pre-date the
        ;; 'fast catchup time', which is usually set to the creation date of the earliest key in the wallet.  Because
        ;; we know there are no transactions using our keys before that date, we need only the headers.  To do that we
        ;; use the "getheaders" command.  Once we find we've gone past the target date, we throw away the downloaded
        ;; headers and then request the blocks from that point onwards.  "getheaders" does not send us an inv, it just

 ; <p>A transaction represents the movement of coins from some addresses to some other addresses.  It can also represent
 ; the minting of new coins.  A Transaction object corresponds to the equivalent in the Bitcoin C++ implementation.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>Transactions are the fundamental atoms of Bitcoin and have many powerful features.  Read
 ; <a href="https://bitcoinj.github.io/working-with-transactions">"Working with transactions"</a> in the
 ; documentation to learn more about how to use this class.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>All Bitcoin transactions are at risk of being reversed, though the risk is much less than with traditional payment
 ; systems.  Transactions have <i>confidence levels</i>, which help you decide whether to trust a transaction or not.
 ; Whether to trust a transaction is something that needs to be decided on a case by case basis - a rule that makes
 ; sense for selling MP3s might not make sense for selling cars, or accepting payments from a family member.  If you
 ; are building a wallet, how to present confidence to your users is something to consider carefully.</p>

 ; <p>A TransactionConfidence object tracks data you can use to make a confidence decision about a transaction.
 ; It also contains some pre-canned rules for common scenarios: if you aren't really sure what level of confidence
 ; you need, these should prove useful.  You can get a confidence object using {@link Transaction#getConfidence()}.
 ; They cannot be constructed directly.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>Confidence in a transaction can come in multiple ways:</p>
 ;
 ; <ul>
 ; <li>Because you created it yourself and only you have the necessary keys.</li>
 ; <li>Receiving it from a fully validating peer you know is trustworthy, for instance, because it's run by yourself.</li>
 ; <li>Receiving it from a peer on the network you randomly chose.  If your network connection is not being
 ;     intercepted, you have a pretty good chance of connecting to a node that is following the rules.</li>
 ; <li>Receiving it from multiple peers on the network.  If your network connection is not being intercepted,
 ;     hearing about a transaction from multiple peers indicates the network has accepted the transaction and
 ;     thus miners likely have too (miners have the final say in whether a transaction becomes valid or not).</li>
 ; <li>Seeing the transaction appear appear in a block on the main chain.  Your confidence increases as the transaction
 ;     becomes further buried under work.  Work can be measured either in blocks (roughly, units of time), or
 ;     amount of work done.</li>
 ; </ul>
 ;
 ; <p>Alternatively, you may know that the transaction is "dead", that is, one or more of its inputs have
 ; been double spent and will never confirm unless there is another re-org.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>TransactionConfidence is updated via the {@link org.bitcoinj.core.TransactionConfidence#incrementDepthInBlocks()}
 ; method to ensure the block depth is up to date.</p>
 ; To make a copy that won't be changed, use {@link org.bitcoinj.core.TransactionConfidence#duplicate()}.

     ; <p>The "compact" format is a representation of a whole number N using an unsigned 32 bit number similar to
     ; a floating point format.  The most significant 8 bits are the unsigned exponent of base 256.  This exponent
     ; can be thought of as "number of bytes of N".  The lower 23 bits are the mantissa.  Bit number 24 (0x800000)
     ; represents the sign of N.  Therefore, N = (-1^sign) * mantissa * 256^(exponent-3).</p>
     ;
     ; <p>Satoshi's original implementation used BN_bn2mpi() and BN_mpi2bn().  MPI uses the most significant bit of
     ; the first byte as sign.  Thus 0x1234560000 is compact 0x05123456 and 0xc0de000000 is compact 0x0600c0de.
     ; Compact 0x05c0de00 would be -0x40de000000.</p>
     ;
     ; <p>Bitcoin only uses this "compact" format for encoding difficulty targets, which are unsigned 256bit quantities.
     ; Thus, all the complexities of the sign bit and using base 256 are probably an implementation accident.</p>

 ; <p>Utility class that wraps the boilerplate needed to set up a new SPV bitcoinj app.  Instantiate it with a directory
 ; and file prefix, optionally configure a few things, then use startAsync and optionally awaitRunning.  The object will
 ; construct and configure a {@link BlockChain}, {@link SPVBlockStore}, {@link Wallet} and {@link PeerGroup}.  Depending
 ; on the value of the blockingStartup property, startup will be considered complete once the block chain has fully
 ; synchronized, so it can take a while.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>To add listeners and modify the objects that are constructed, you can either do that by overriding the
 ; {@link #onSetupCompleted()} method (which will run on a background thread) and make your changes there,
 ; or by waiting for the service to start and then accessing the objects from wherever you want.  However, you cannot
 ; access the objects this class creates until startup is complete.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>The asynchronous design of this class may seem puzzling (just use {@link #awaitRunning()} if you don't want that).
 ; It is to make it easier to fit bitcoinj into GUI apps, which require a high degree of responsiveness on their main
 ; thread which handles all the animation and user interaction.  Even when blockingStart is false, initializing bitcoinj
 ; means doing potentially blocking file IO, generating keys and other potentially intensive operations.  By running it
 ; on a background thread, there's no risk of accidentally causing UI lag.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>Note that {@link #awaitRunning()} can throw an unchecked {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}
 ; if anything goes wrong during startup - you should probably handle it and use {@link Exception#getCause()} to figure
 ; out what went wrong more precisely.  Same thing if you just use the {@link #startAsync()} method.</p>

 ; does not hold any locks whilst this object is used, relying on the single thread to prevent multiple filters being
 ; calculated in parallel, thus a filter provider can do things like make blocking calls into PeerGroup from a separate
 ; thread.  However the bloomFilterFPRate property IS thread safe, for convenience.</p>

 ; <p>An implementor of FullPrunedBlockStore saves StoredBlock objects to some storage mechanism.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>In addition to keeping track of a chain using {@link StoredBlock}s, it should also keep track of
 ; a second copy of the chain which holds {@link StoredUndoableBlock}s.  In this way, an application can
 ; perform a headers-only initial sync and then use that information to more efficiently download a locally
 ; verified full copy of the block chain.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>A FullPrunedBlockStore should function well as a standard {@link BlockStore} and then be able to
 ; trivially switch to being used as a FullPrunedBlockStore.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>It should store the {@link StoredUndoableBlock}s of a number of recent blocks before verifiedHead.height
 ; and all those after verifiedHead.height.
 ; It is advisable to store any {@link StoredUndoableBlock} which has a height > verifiedHead.height - N.
 ; Because N determines the memory usage, it is recommended that N be customizable.  N should be chosen such
 ; that re-orgs beyond that point are vanishingly unlikely, e.g. a few thousand blocks is a reasonable choice.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>It must store the {@link StoredBlock} of all blocks.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>A FullPrunedBlockStore contains a map of hashes to [Full]StoredBlock.  The hash is the double digest of
 ; the Bitcoin serialization of the block header, <b>not</b> the header with the extra data as well.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>A FullPrunedBlockStore also contains a map of hash+index to UTXO.  Again, the hash is
 ; a standard Bitcoin double-SHA256 hash of the transaction.</p>

;;;
 ; <p>Instances of this class format and parse locale-specific numerical representations of Bitcoin monetary values.
 ;
 ; <p>A primary goal of this class is to minimize the danger of human-misreading of monetary values due to mis-counting
 ; the number of zeros (or, more generally, of decimal places) in the number that represents a Bitcoin monetary value.
 ; Some of the features offered for doing this are:
 ; <ol>
 ;   <li>automatic adjustment of denominational units in which a value is represented so as to lessen the number of adjacent zeros,
 ;   <li>use of locale-specific decimal-separators to group digits in the integer portion of formatted numbers,
 ;   <li>fine control over the number and  grouping of fractional decimal places, and
 ;   <li>access to character information that allows for vertical alignment of tabular columns of formatted values.
 ; </ol>
 ;
 ; <h3>Basic Usage</h3>
 ;
 ; Basic usage is very simple:
 ; <ol>
 ;   <li>Construct a new formatter object using one of the factory methods.
 ;   <li>Format a value by passing it as an argument to the {@link BtcFormat#format(Object)} method.
 ;   <li>Parse a value by passing a <code>String</code>-type representation of it to the {@link BtcFormat#parse(String)} method.
 ; </ol>
 ;
 ; <p>For example, depending on your locale, values might be formatted and parsed as follows:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; BtcFormat f = BtcFormat.getInstance();
 ; String c = f.format(Coin.COIN);                <strong>// "BTC 1.00"</strong>
 ; String k = f.format(Coin.COIN.multiply(1000)); <strong>// "BTC 1,000.00"</strong>
 ; String m = f.format(Coin.COIN.divide(1000));   <strong>// "mBTC 1.00"</strong>
 ; Coin all = f.parseObject("M฿ 21");             <strong>// All the money in the world</strong>
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; <h3>Auto-Denomination versus Fixed-Denomination</h3>
 ;
 ; There are two provided concrete classes, one that automatically denominates values to be formatted, {@link BtcAutoFormat},
 ; and another that formats any value in units of a fixed, specified denomination, {@link BtcFixedFormat}.
 ;
 ; <h5>Automatic Denomination</h5>
 ;
 ; Automatic denomination means that the formatter adjusts the denominational units in which a formatted number is
 ; expressed based on the monetary value that number represents.  An auto-denominating formatter is defined by its
 ; style, specified by one of the enumerated values of {@link BtcAutoFormat.Style}.  There are two styles constants:
 ; {@link BtcAutoFormat.Style#CODE} (the default), and {@link BtcAutoFormat.Style#SYMBOL}.  The difference is that
 ; the <code>CODE</code> style uses an internationally-distinct currency code, such as <code>"BTC"</code>, to indicate
 ; the units of denomination, while the <code>SYMBOL</code> style uses a possibly-ambiguous currency symbol such as
 ; <code>"฿"</code>.
 ;
 ; <p>The denomination used when formatting will be either bitcoin, millicoin or microcoin, depending on the value
 ; being represented, chosen so as to minimize the number of consecutive zeros displayed without losing precision.
 ; For example, depending on the locale, a value of one bitcoin might be formatted as <pre>฿1.00</pre> where a value
 ; exceeding that by one satoshi would be <pre>µ฿1,000,000.01</pre>.
 ;
 ; <h5>Fixed Denomination</h5>
 ;
 ; Fixed denomination means that the same denomination of units is used for every value that is formatted or parsed
 ; by a given formatter instance.  A fixed-denomination formatter is defined by its scale, which is the number of
 ; places one must shift the decimal point in increasing precision to convert the representation of a given quantity
 ; of bitcoins into a representation of the same value denominated in the formatter's units.  For example, a scale
 ; value of <code>3</code> specifies a denomination of millibitcoins, because to represent <code>1.0000 BTC</code>,
 ; or one bitcoin, in millibitcoins, one shifts the decimal point three places, that is, to <code>1000.0 mBTC</code>.
 ;
 ; <h3>Construction</h3>
 ;
 ; There are two ways to obtain an instance of this class:
 ; <ol>
 ;   <li>Use one of the factory methods; or
 ;   <li>Use a {@link BtcFormat.Builder} object.
 ; </ol>
 ;
 ; <p>The factory methods are appropriate for basic use where the default configuration is either used or modified.
 ; The <code>Builder</code> class provides more control over the configuration, and gives access to some features
 ; not available through the factory methods, such as using custom formatting patterns and currency symbols.
 ;
 ; <h5>Factory Methods</h5>
 ;
 ; Although formatting and parsing is performed by one of the concrete subclasses, you can obtain formatters using
 ; the various static factory methods of this abstract base class <code>BtcFormat</code>.  There are a variety of
 ; overloaded methods that allow you to obtain a formatter that behaves according to your needs.
 ;
 ; <p>The primary distinction is between automatic- and fixed-denomination formatters.  By default, the
 ; <code>getInstance()</code> method with no arguments returns a new, automatic-denominating <code>BtcAutoFormat</code>
 ; instance for your default locale that will display exactly two fractional decimal places and a currency code.
 ; For example, if you happen to be in the USA:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; BtcFormat f = BtcFormat.getInstance();
 ; String s = f.format(Coin.COIN); <strong>// "BTC 1.00"</strong>
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; <p>The first argument to <code>getInstance()</code> can determine whether you get an auto- or fixed-denominating
 ; formatter.  If the type of the first argument is an <code>int</code>, then the value of that <code>int</code>
 ; will be interpreted as the decimal-place scale of the {@link BtcFixedFormat} instance that is returned, and thus
 ; will determine its denomination.  For example, if you want to format values in units of microbitcoins:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; BtcFormat m = BtcFormat.getInstance(6);
 ; String s = m.format(Coin.COIN); <strong>// "1,000,000.00"</strong>
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; <p>This class provides several constants bound to common scale values:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; BtcFormat milliFormat = BtcFormat.getInstance(MILLICOIN_SCALE);
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; <p>Alternatively, if the type of the first argument to <code>getInstance()</code> is one of the enumerated values
 ; of the {@link BtcAutoFormat.Style} type, either <code>CODE</code> or <code>SYMBOL</code>, then you will get a
 ; {@link BtcAutoFormat} instance that uses either a currency code or symbol, respectively, to indicate the results
 ; of its auto-denomination.
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; BtcFormat s = BtcFormat.getInstance(SYMBOL);
 ; Coin value = Coin.parseCoin("0.1234");
 ; String mil = s.format(value);              <strong>// "₥฿123.40"</strong>
 ; String mic = s.format(value.divide(1000)); <strong>// "µ฿123.40"</strong>
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; <p>An alternative way to specify whether you want an auto- or fixed-denomination formatter is to use one
 ; of the factory methods that is named to indicate that characteristics of the new instance returned.  For
 ; fixed-denomination formatters, these methods are {@link #getCoinInstance()}, {@link #getMilliInstance()},
 ; and {@link #getMicroInstance()}.  These three methods are equivalent to invoking <code>getInstance()</code>
 ; with a first argument of <code>0</code>, <code>3</code> and <code>6</code>, respectively.  For auto-denominating
 ; formatters the relevant factory methods are {@link #getCodeInstance()} and {@link #getSymbolInstance()},
 ; which are equivalent to <code>getInstance(Style.CODE)</code>, and <code>getInstance(Style.SYMBOL)</code>.
 ;
 ; <p>Regardless of how you specify whether your new formatter is to be of automatic- or fixed-denomination, the
 ; next (and possibly first) parameter to each of the factory methods is an optional <code>Locale</code> value.
 ;
 ; For example, here we construct four instances for the same locale that each format
 ; differently the same one-bitcoin value:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; <strong>// Next line returns "1,00 BTC"</strong>
 ; BtcFormat.getInstance(Locale.GERMANY).format(Coin.COIN);
 ; <strong>// Next line returns "1,00 ฿"</strong>
 ; BtcFormat.getInstance(SYMBOL, Locale.GERMANY).format(Coin.COIN);
 ; <strong>// Next line returns "1.000,00"</strong>
 ; BtcFormat.getMilliInstance(Locale.GERMANY).format(Coin.COIN);
 ; <strong>// Next line returns "10.000,00"</strong>
 ; BtcFormat.getInstance(4, Locale.GERMANY).format(Coin.COIN);
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; Omitting such a <code>Locale</code> parameter will give you a formatter for your default locale.
 ;
 ; <p>The final (and possibly only) arguments to the factory methods serve to set the default number of
 ; fractional decimal places that will be displayed when formatting monetary values.  In the case of an
 ; auto-denominating formatter, this can be a single <code>int</code> value, which will determine the number
 ; of fractional decimal places to be used in all cases, except where either (1) doing so would provide
 ; a place for fractional satoshis, or (2) that default value is overridden when invoking
 ; the <code>format()</code> method as described below.
 ;
 ; <p>In the case of a fixed-denomination formatter, you can pass any number of <code>int</code> values.
 ; The first will determine the minimum number of fractional decimal places, and each following <code>int</code>
 ; value specifies the size of an optional group of decimal-places to be displayed only if useful for expressing
 ; precision.  As with auto-denominating formatters, numbers will never be formatted with a decimal place that
 ; represents a fractional quantity of satoshis, and these defaults can be overridden by arguments to the
 ; <code>format()</code> method.  See below for examples.
 ;
 ; <h5>The <code>Builder</code> Class</h5>
 ;
 ; A new {@link BtcFormat.Builder} instance is returned by the {@link #builder()} method.  Such an object has
 ; methods that set the configuration parameters of a <code>BtcFormat</code> object.  Its {@link Builder#build()}
 ; method constructs and returns a <code>BtcFormat</code> instance configured according to those settings.
 ;
 ; <p>In addition to setter-methods that correspond to the factory-method parameters explained above,
 ; a <code>Builder</code> also allows you to specify custom formatting and parsing patterns and currency symbols
 ; and codes.  For example, rather than using the default currency symbol, which has the same unicode character
 ; point as the national currency symbol of Thailand, some people prefer to use a capital letter "B" with
 ; a vertical overstrike.
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; BtcFormat.Builder builder = BtcFormat.builder();
 ; builder.style(SYMBOL);
 ; builder.symbol("B&#x5c;u20e6"); <strong>// unicode char "double vertical stroke overlay"</strong>
 ; BtcFormat f = builder.build();
 ; String out = f.format(COIN); <strong>// "B⃦1.00" depending on locale</strong>
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; The <code>Builder</code> methods are chainable.  So, for example, if you are
 ; deferential to ISO 4217, you might construct a formatter in a single line this way:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; BtcFormat f = BtcFormat.builder().style(CODE).code("XBT").build();
 ; String out = f.format(COIN); <strong>// "XBT 1.00"</strong>
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; <p>See the documentation of the {@link BtcFormat.Builder} class for details.
 ;
 ; <h3>Formatting</h3>
 ;
 ; <p>You format a Bitcoin monetary value by passing it to the {@link BtcFormat#format(Object)} method.  This argument
 ; can be either a {@link org.bitcoinj.core.Coin}-type object or a numerical object such as {@link java.lang.Long} or
 ; {@link java.math.BigDecimal}.  Integer-based types such as {@link java.math.BigInteger} are interpreted as representing
 ; a number of satoshis, while a {@link java.math.BigDecimal} is interpreted as representing a number of bitcoins.
 ; A value having a fractional amount of satoshis is rounded to the nearest whole satoshi at least, and possibly to
 ; a greater unit depending on the number of fractional decimal-places displayed.  The <code>format()</code> method will
 ; not accept an argument whose type is <code>String</code>, <code>Float</code> nor <code>Double</code>.
 ;
 ; <p>Subsequent to the monetary value to be formatted, the {@link #format(Object)} method also accepts as arguments
 ; optional <code>int</code> values that specify the number of decimal places to use to represent the fractional portion
 ; of the number.  This overrides the default, and enables a single formatter instance to be reused, formatting different
 ; values that require different numbers of fractional decimal places.  These parameters have the same meaning as those
 ; that set the default values in the factory methods as described above.  Namely, a single <code>int</code> value determines
 ; the minimum number of fractional decimal places that will be used in all cases, to a precision limit of satoshis.
 ; Instances of {@link BtcFixedFormat} also accept a variable-length sequence of additional <code>int</code> values, each
 ; of which specifies the size of a group of fractional decimal-places to be used in addition to all preceding places, only
 ; if useful to express precision, and only to a maximum precision of satoshis.  For example:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; BtcFormat f = BtcFormat.getCoinInstance();
 ; Coin value = COIN.add(Coin.valueOf(5)); <strong>// 100000005 satoshis</strong>
 ; f.format(value, 2);       <strong>// "1.00"</strong>
 ; f.format(value, 3);       <strong>// "1.000"</strong>
 ; f.format(value, 2, 3);    <strong>// "1.00" three more zeros doesn't help</strong>
 ; f.format(value, 2, 3, 3); <strong>// "1.00000005" </strong>
 ; f.format(value, 2, 3, 4); <strong>// "1.00000005" fractions of satoshis have no place</strong>
 ; f.format(value, 2, 3, 2); <strong>// "1.0000001" rounds to nearest usable place</strong>
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; <p>Note that if using all the fractional decimal places in a specified group would give a place to fractions of satoshis,
 ; then the size of that group will be reduced to a maximum precision of satoshis.  Either all or none of the allowed decimal
 ; places of that group will still be applied as doing so is useful for expressing the precision of the value being formatted.
 ;
 ; <p>Several convenient constants of repeating group-size sequences are provided: {@link BtcFixedFormat#REPEATING_PLACES},
 ; {@link BtcFixedFormat#REPEATING_DOUBLETS} and {@link BtcFixedFormat#REPEATING_TRIPLETS}.  These signify repeating groups
 ; of one, two and three decimals places, respectively.  For example, to display only as many fractional places as useful
 ; in order to prevent hanging zeros on the least-significant end of formatted numbers:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; format(value, 0, REPEATING_PLACES);
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; <p>When using an automatically-denominating formatter, you might want to know what denomination was chosen.  You can get
 ; the currency-units indicator, as well as any other field in the formatted output, by using a {@link java.text.FieldPosition}
 ; instance constructed using an appropriate constant from the {@link java.text.NumberFormat.Field} class:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; BtcFormat de = BtcFormat.getInstance(Locale.GERMANY);
 ; FieldPosition currField = new FieldPosition(NumberFormat.Field.CURRENCY);
 ; <strong>// next line formats the value as "987.654.321,23 µBTC"</strong>
 ; String output = de.format(valueOf(98765432123L), new StringBuffer(), currField);
 ; <strong>// next line sets variable currencyCode to "µBTC"</strong>
 ; String currencyCode = output.substring(currField.getBeginIndex(), currField.getEndIndex()));

 ;
 ; <p>When using a fixed-denomination formatter whose scale can be expressed as a standard "metric" prefix,
 ; you can invoke the <code>code()</code> and <code>symbol()</code> methods to obtain a <code>String</code>
 ; whose value is the appropriate currency code or symbol, respectively, for that formatter.
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; BtcFixedFormat kilo = (BtcFixedFormat)BtcFormat(-3); <strong>// scale -3 for kilocoins</strong>
 ; Coin value = Coin.parseCoin("1230");
 ; <strong>// variable coded will be set to "kBTC 1.23"</strong>
 ; String coded = kilo.code() + " " + kilo.format(value);
 ; <strong>// variable symbolic will be set to "k฿1.23"</strong>
 ; String symbolic = kilo.symbol() + kilo.format(value);
 ; BtcFormat(4).code(); <strong>// unnamed denomination has no code; raises exception</strong>
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; <h5>Formatting for Tabular Columns</h5>
 ;
 ; When displaying tables of monetary values, you can lessen the risk of human misreading-error by vertically
 ; aligning the decimal separator of those values.  This example demonstrates one way to do that:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; <strong>// The elements of this array are the values we will format:</strong>
 ; Coin[] rows = { MAX_MONEY, MAX_MONEY.subtract(SATOSHI), Coin.parseCoin("1234"), COIN,
 ;                 COIN.divide(1000), valueOf(10000), valueOf(1000), valueOf(100), SATOSHI };
 ; BtcFormat f = BtcFormat.getCoinInstance(2, REPEATING_PLACES);
 ; FieldPosition fp = new FieldPosition(DECIMAL_SEPARATOR); <strong>// see java.text.NumberFormat.Field</strong>
 ; String[] output = new String[rows.length];
 ; int[] indexes = new int[rows.length];
 ; int maxIndex = 0;
 ; for (int i = 0; i < rows.length; i++)
 ; {
 ;     output[i] = f.format(rows[i], new StringBuffer(), fp).toString();
 ;     indexes[i] = fp.getBeginIndex();
 ;     if (maxIndex < indexes[i])
 ;         maxIndex = indexes[i];
 ; }
 ; for (int i = 0; i < output.length; i++)
 ; {
 ;     System.out.println(repeat(" ", maxIndex - indexes[i]) + output[i]);
 ; }
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; Assuming you are using a monospaced font, and depending on your locale, the foregoing will print the following:
 ;
 ; <blockquote><pre>
 ; 21,000,000.00
 ; 20,999,999.99999999
 ;      1,234.00
 ;          1.00
 ;          0.001
 ;          0.0001
 ;          0.00001
 ;          0.000001
 ;          0.00000001
 ; </pre></blockquote>
 ;
 ; If you need to vertically-align columns printed in a proportional font, then see the documentation
 ; for the {@link java.text.NumberFormat} class for an explanation of how to do that.
 ;
 ; <h3>Parsing</h3>
 ;
 ; <p>The {@link #parse(String)} method accepts a <code>String</code> argument, and returns a {@link Coin}-type value.
 ; The difference in parsing behavior between instances of {@link BtcFixedFormat} and {@link BtcAutoFormat} is analogous
 ; to the difference in formatting behavior between instances of those classes.  Instances of {@link BtcAutoFormat} recognize
 ; currency codes and symbols in the <code>String</code> being parsed, and interpret them as indicators of the units in which
 ; the number being parsed is denominated.  On the other hand, instances of {@link BtcFixedFormat} by default recognize no
 ; codes nor symbols, but rather interpret every number as being denominated in the units that were specified when constructing
 ; the instance doing the parsing.  This default behavior of {@link BtcFixedFormat} can be overridden by setting a parsing
 ; pattern that includes a currency sign using the {@link BtcFormat.Builder#pattern()} method.
 ;
 ; <p>The {@link BtcAutoFormat#parse(String)}</code> method of {@link BtcAutoFormat} (and of {@link BtcAutoFormat} configured
 ; with applicable non-default pattern) will recognize a variety of currency symbols and codes, including all standard
 ; international (metric) prefixes from micro to mega.  For example, denominational units of microcoins may be specified
 ; by <code>µ฿</code>, <code>u฿</code>, <code>µB⃦</code>, <code>µɃ</code>, <code>µBTC</code> or other appropriate permutations
 ; of those characters.  Additionally, if either or both of a custom currency code or symbol is configured using
 ; {@link BtcFormat.Builder#code} or {@link BtcFormat.Builder#code}, then such code or symbol will be recognized in addition
 ; to those recognized by default.
 ;
 ; <p>Instances of this class that recognize currency signs will recognize both currency symbols and codes, regardless of which
 ; that instance uses for formatting.  However, if the style is <code>CODE</code> (and unless overridden by a custom pattern)
 ; then a space character must separate the units indicator from the number.  When parsing with a <code>SYMBOL</code>-style
 ; <code>BtcFormat</code> instance, on the other hand, whether or not the units indicator must be separated by a space from
 ; the number is determined by the locale.  The {@link BtcFormat#pattern()} method returns a representation of the pattern
 ; that can be examined to determine whether a space must separate currency signs from numbers in parsed <code>String</code>s.
 ;
 ; <p>When parsing, if the currency-units indicator is absent, then a {@link BtcAutoFormat} instance will infer a denomination
 ; of bitcoins while a {@link BtcFixedFormat} will infer the denomination in which it expresses formatted values.  Note: by
 ; default (unless overridden by a custom pattern), if the locale or style requires a space to separate the number from the
 ; units indicator, that space must be present in the String to be parsed, even if the units indicator is absent.
 ;
 ; <p>The <code>parse()</code> method returns an instance of the {@link Coin} class.  Therefore, attempting to parse a value
 ; greater than the maximum that a <code>Coin</code> object can represent will raise a <code>ParseException</code>, as will
 ; any other detected parsing error.
 ;
 ; <h3>Limitations</h3>
 ;
 ; <h5>Parsing</h5>
 ;
 ; Parsing is performed by an underlying {@link java.text.NumberFormat} object.  While this delivers the benefit
 ; of recognizing locale-specific patterns, some have criticized other aspects of its behavior.  For example, see
 ; <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-numberformat/">this article by Joe Sam Shirah</a>.  In particular,
 ; explicit positive-signs are not recognized.  If you are parsing input from end-users, then you should consider whether
 ; you would benefit from any of the work-arounds mentioned in that article.
 ;
 ; <h5>Exotic Locales</h5>
 ;
 ; This class is not well-tested in locales that use non-ascii character sets, especially those where writing proceeds
 ; from right-to-left.  Helpful feedback in that regard is appreciated.
 ;
 ; <h3>Thread-Safety</h3>
 ;
 ; <p>Instances of this class are immutable.

(§ class #_"BtcFormat" (§ extends #_"Format")
    ;; CONCURRENCY NOTES
     ;
     ; There is one mutable member of this class, the `DecimalFormat` object bound to variable `numberFormat`.
     ; The relevant methods invoked on it are: setMinimumFractionDigits(), setMaximumFractionDigits(), and
     ; setDecimalFormatSymbols(), along with the respective getter methods corresponding to each.  The first
     ; two methods are used to set the number of fractional decimal places displayed when formatting, which is
     ; reflected in the patterns returned by the public pattern() and localizedPattern() methods.  The last
     ; method sets the value of that object's member `DecimalFormatSymbols` object for formatting and parsing,
     ; which is also reflected in the aforementioned patterns.  The patterns, which are the passed-through
     ; return values of the DecimalFormat object's toPattern() and toLocalizedPattern() methods, and the value
     ; of the DecimalFormat object's DecimalFormatSymbols member are among the values compared between instances
     ; of this class in determining the return values of the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods.
     ;
     ; From the foregoing, you can understand that immutability is achieved as follows: access to the variable
     ; `numberFormat` referent's fraction-digits and format-symbols fields are synchronized on that DecimalFormat
     ; object.  The state of those fraction-digits limits and decimal-format symbols must be returned to a static
     ; state after being changed for formatting or parsing since the user can see them reflected in the return
     ; values of above-mentioned methods and because `equals()` and `hashCode()` use them for comparisons.

;;;
 ; <p>A deterministic key chain is a {@link KeyChain} that uses the
 ; <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP 32 standard</a>, as implemented by
 ; {@link org.bitcoinj.crypto.DeterministicHierarchy}, to derive all the keys in the keychain from a master seed.
 ; This type of wallet is extremely convenient and flexible.  Although backing up full wallet files is always a good
 ; idea, to recover money only the root seed needs to be preserved and that is a number small enough that it can be
 ; written down on paper or, when represented using a BIP 39 {@link org.bitcoinj.crypto.MnemonicCode},
 ; dictated over the phone (possibly even memorized).</p>
 ;
 ; <p>Deterministic key chains have other advantages: parts of the key tree can be selectively revealed to allow
 ; for auditing, and new public keys can be generated without access to the private keys, yielding a highly secure
 ; configuration for web servers which can accept payments into a wallet but not spend from them.  This does not work
 ; quite how you would expect due to a quirk of elliptic curve mathematics and the techniques used to deal with it.
 ; A watching wallet is not instantiated using the public part of the master key as you may imagine.  Instead, you
 ; need to take the account key (first child of the master key) and provide the public part of that to the watching
 ; wallet instead.  You can do this by calling {@link #getWatchingKey()} and then serializing it with
 ; {@link org.bitcoinj.crypto.DeterministicKey#serializePubB58(org.bitcoinj.core.NetworkParameters)}.  The resulting
 ; "xpub..." string encodes sufficient information about the account key to create a watching chain via
 ; {@link org.bitcoinj.crypto.DeterministicKey#deserializeB58(org.bitcoinj.crypto.DeterministicKey, String, org.bitcoinj.core.NetworkParameters)}
 ; (with null as the first parameter) and then
 ; {@link DeterministicKeyChain#DeterministicKeyChain(org.bitcoinj.crypto.DeterministicKey)}.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>This class builds on {@link org.bitcoinj.crypto.DeterministicHierarchy} and {@link org.bitcoinj.crypto.DeterministicKey}
 ; by adding support for serialization to and from protobufs, and encryption of parts of the key tree.  Internally it
 ; arranges itself as per the BIP 32 spec, with the seed being used to derive a master key, which is then used to derive
 ; an account key, the account key is used to derive two child keys called the <i>internal</i> and <i>external</i> parent
 ; keys (for change and handing out addresses respectively) and finally the actual leaf keys that users use hanging off
 ; the end.  The leaf keys are special in that they don't internally store the private part at all, instead choosing to
 ; rederive the private key from the parent when needed for signing.  This simplifies the design for encrypted key chains.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>The key chain manages a <i>lookahead zone</i>.  This zone is required because when scanning the chain, you don't
 ; know exactly which keys might receive payments.  The user may have handed out several addresses and received payments
 ; on them, but for latency reasons the block chain is requested from remote peers in bulk, meaning you must
 ; "look ahead" when calculating keys to put in the Bloom filter.  The default lookahead zone is 100 keys, meaning
 ; if the user hands out more than 100 addresses and receives payment on them before the chain is next scanned, some
 ; transactions might be missed.  100 is a reasonable choice for consumer wallets running on CPU constrained devices.
 ; For industrial wallets that are receiving keys all the time, a higher value is more appropriate.  Ideally DKC and
 ; the wallet would know how to adjust this value automatically, but that's not implemented at the moment.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>In fact the real size of the lookahead zone is larger than requested, by default, it's one third larger.  This
 ; is because the act of deriving new keys means recalculating the Bloom filters and this is an expensive operation.
 ; Thus, to ensure we don't have to recalculate on every single new key/address requested or seen we add more buffer
 ; space and only extend the lookahead zone when that buffer is exhausted.  For example with a lookahead zone of 100
 ; keys, you can request 33 keys before more keys will be calculated and the Bloom filter rebuilt and rebroadcast.
 ; But even when you are requesting the 33rd key, you will still be looking 100 keys ahead.</p>

 ; <p>A KeyChainGroup is used by the {@link org.bitcoinj.wallet.Wallet} and manages: a {@link BasicKeyChain} object

 ; created lazily/on demand when a fresh or current key is requested, possibly being initialized from the private key
 ; bytes of the earliest non rotating key in the basic key chain if one is available, or from a fresh random seed if not.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>If a key rotation time is set, it may be necessary to add a new DeterministicKeyChain with a fresh seed and
 ; also preserve the old one, so funds can be swept from the rotating keys.  In this case, there may be more than
 ; one deterministic chain.  The latest chain is called the active chain and is where new keys are served from.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>The wallet delegates most key management tasks to this class.  It is <b>not</b> thread safe and requires external
 ; locking, i.e. by the wallet lock.  The group then in turn delegates most operations to the key chain objects,
 ; combining their responses together when necessary.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>Deterministic key chains have a concept of a lookahead size and threshold.  Please see the discussion in the
 ; class docs for {@link DeterministicKeyChain} for more information on this topic.</p>

;; To do list:
;;
;; - Take all wallet-relevant data out of Transaction and put it into WalletTransaction.  Make Transaction immutable.
;; - Only store relevant transaction outputs, don't bother storing the rest of the data.  Big RAM saving.
;; - Split block chain and tx output tracking into a superclass that doesn't have any key or spending related code.
;; - Simplify how transactions are tracked and stored: in particular, have the wallet maintain positioning information
;;   for transactions independent of the transactions themselves, so the timeline can be walked without having to
;;   process and sort every single transaction.
;; - Split data persistence out into a backend class and make the wallet transactional, so we can store a wallet
;;   in a database not just in RAM.
;; - Make clearing of transactions able to only rewind the wallet a certain distance instead of all blocks.
;; - Make it scale:
;;     - eliminate all the algorithms with quadratic complexity (or worse).
;;     - don't require everything to be held in RAM at once.
;;     - consider allowing eviction of no longer re-orgable transactions or keys that were used up.
;;
;; Finally, find more ways to break the class up and decompose it.  Currently every time we move code out, other code
;; fills up the lines saved!

;;;
 ; <p>A Wallet stores keys and a record of transactions that send and receive value from those keys.  Using these,
 ; it is able to create new transactions that spend the recorded transactions, and this is the fundamental operation
 ; of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>To learn more about this class, read <b><a href="https://bitcoinj.github.io/working-with-the-wallet">working with the wallet.</a></b></p>
 ;
 ; <p>To fill up a Wallet with transactions, you need to use it in combination with a {@link BlockChain} and various
 ; other objects, see the <a href="https://bitcoinj.github.io/getting-started">Getting started</a> tutorial
 ; on the website to learn more about how to set everything up.</p>
 ;
 ; <p>Wallets can be serialized using protocol buffers.  You need to save the wallet whenever it changes, there is an
 ; auto-save feature that simplifies this for you although you're still responsible for manually triggering a save when
 ; your app is about to quit because the auto-save feature waits a moment before actually committing to disk to avoid IO
 ; thrashing when the wallet is changing very fast (e.g. due to a block chain sync).  See
 ; {@link Wallet#autosaveToFile(java.io.File, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, org.bitcoinj.wallet.WalletFiles.Listener)}
 ; for more information about this.</p>

    ;;           If a double spend appears in the pending state as well, we update the confidence type
    ;;           of all txns in conflict to IN_CONFLICT and wait for the miners to resolve the race.
    ;; Unspent:  Transactions that appeared in the best chain and have outputs we can spend.  Note that we store the
    ;;           entire transaction in memory even though for spending purposes we only really need the outputs, the
    ;;           reason being that this simplifies handling of re-orgs.  It would be worth fixing this in future.

 ; serialization and disk IO on a background thread performance can be improved.

 ; Serialize and de-serialize a wallet to a byte stream containing a
 ; <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview">protocol buffer</a>.  Protocol buffers are
 ; a data interchange format developed by Google with an efficient binary representation, a type safe specification
 ; language and compilers that generate code to work with those data structures for many languages.  Protocol buffers
 ; can have their format evolved over time: conceptually they represent data using (tag, length, value) tuples.  The
 ; format is defined by the <tt>wallet.proto</tt> file in the bitcoinj source distribution.
 ;
 ; This class is used through its static methods.  The most common operations are writeWallet and readWallet, which do
 ; the obvious operations on Output/InputStreams.  You can use a {@link java.io.ByteArrayInputStream} and equivalent
 ; {@link java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream} if you'd like byte arrays instead.  The protocol buffer can also be manipulated
 ; in its object form if you'd like to modify the flattened data structure before serialization to binary.
 ;
 ; You can extend the wallet format with additional fields specific to your application if you want, but make sure
 ; to either put the extra data in the provided extension areas, or select tag numbers that are unlikely to be used
 ; by anyone else.
