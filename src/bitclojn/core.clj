     ; The "compact" format is a representation of a whole number N using an unsigned 32 bit number similar to

     ; can be thought of as "number of bytes of N".  The lower 23 bits are the mantissa.  Bit number 24 (0x800000)

 ; A BlockChain implementation must be connected to a {@link BlockStore} implementation.  The chain object
 ; by itself doesn't store any data, that's delegated to the store.  Which store you use is a decision best made by
 ; reading the getting started guide, but briefly, fully validating block chains need fully validating stores.
 ; In the lightweight SPV mode, a {@link SPVBlockStore} is the right choice.
 ;
 ; This class implements an abstract class which makes it simple to create a SPVBlockChain that does/doesn't do
 ; full verification.  It verifies headers and is implements most of what is required to implement SPV mode, but
 ; also provides callback hooks which can be used to do full verification.
 ;
 ; There are two subclasses of BlockChain that are useful: {@link SPVBlockChain}, which is the simplest
 ; class and implements <i>simplified payment verification</i>.  This is a lightweight and efficient mode that
 ; does not verify the contents of blocks, just their headers.  A {@link FullPrunedBlockChain} paired with a
 ; {@link H2FullPrunedBlockStore} implements full verification, which is equivalent to Bitcoin Core.
 ;
 ; To learn more about the alternative security models, please consult the articles on the website.
 ;
 ; <b>Theory</b>
 ;
 ; The 'chain' is actually a tree although in normal operation it operates mostly as a list of {@link Block}s.
 ; When multiple new head blocks are found simultaneously, there are multiple stories of the economy competing to become
 ; the one true consensus.  This can happen naturally when two miners solve a block within a few seconds of each other,
 ; or it can happen when the chain is under attack.
 ;
 ; A reference to the head block of the best known chain is stored.  If you can reach the genesis block by repeatedly
 ; walking through the prevBlock pointers, then we say this is a full chain.  If you cannot reach the genesis block
 ; we say it is an orphan chain.  Orphan chains can occur when blocks are solved and received during the initial block
 ; chain download, or if we connect to a peer that doesn't send us blocks in order.
 ;
 ; A reorganize occurs when the blocks that make up the best known chain changes.  Note that simply adding a
 ; new block to the top of the best chain isn't as reorganize, but that a reorganize is always triggered by adding
 ; a new block that connects to some other (non best head) block.  By "best" we mean the chain representing the largest
 ; amount of work done.
 ;
 ; Every so often the block chain passes a difficulty transition point.  At that time, all the blocks in the last
 ; 2016 blocks are examined and a new difficulty target is calculated from them.

 ; Base58 is a way to encode Bitcoin addresses (or arbitrary data) as alphanumeric strings.
 ;
 ; Note that this is not the same base58 as used by Flickr, which you may find referenced around the Internet.
 ;
 ; Satoshi explains: why base-58 instead of standard base-64 encoding?
 ; <ul>
 ; <li>Don't want 0OIl characters that look the same in some fonts and
 ;     could be used to create visually identical looking account numbers.</li>
 ; <li>A string with non-alphanumeric characters is not as easily accepted as an account number.</li>
 ; <li>E-mail usually won't line-break if there's no punctuation to break at.</li>
 ; <li>Doubleclicking selects the whole number as one word if it's all alphanumeric.</li>
 ; </ul>
 ;
 ; However, note that the encoding/decoding runs in O(n&sup2;) time, so it is not useful for large data.
 ;
 ; The basic idea of the encoding is to treat the data bytes as a large number represented using
 ; base-256 digits, convert the number to be represented using base-58 digits, preserve the exact
 ; number of leading zeros (which are otherwise lost during the mathematical operations on the
 ; numbers), and finally represent the resulting base-58 digits as alphanumeric ASCII characters.

 ; use of available network bandwidth and CPU time.
 ;
 ; Because a Bloom filter is probabilistic, it has a configurable false positive rate.  So the filter will sometimes
 ; match transactions that weren't inserted into it, but it will never fail to match transactions that were.  This is
 ; a useful privacy feature - if you have spare bandwidth the false positive rate can be increased so the remote peer
 ; gets a noisy picture of what transactions are relevant to your wallet.

 ; Those "checkpoints" can be found in Ledger.
 ;
 ; The file format consists of the string "CHECKPOINTS 1", followed by a uint32 containing the number of signatures
 ; to read.  The value may not be larger than 256 (so it could have been a byte but isn't for historical reasons).
 ; If the number of signatures is larger than zero, each 65 byte ECDSA secp256k1 signature then follows.
 ; The signatures sign the hash of all bytes that follow the last signature.
 ;
 ; After the signatures come an int32 containing the number of checkpoints in the file.  Then each checkpoint follows
 ; one after the other.  A checkpoint is 12 bytes for the total work done field, 4 bytes for the height, 80 bytes
 ; for the block header and then 1 zero byte at the end (i.e. number of transactions in the block: always zero).

 ; Represents an elliptic curve public and (optionally) private key, usable for digital signatures but not encryption.
 ; Creating a new ECKey with the empty constructor will generate a new random keypair.  Other static methods can be used
 ; when you already have the public or private parts.  If you create a key with only the public part, you can check
 ; signatures but not create them.
 ;
 ; ECKey also provides access to Bitcoin Core compatible text message signing, as accessible via the UI or JSON-RPC.
 ; This is slightly different to signing raw bytes - if you want to sign your own data and it won't be exposed as
 ; text to people, you don't want to use this.  If in doubt, ask on the mailing list.
 ;
 ; The ECDSA algorithm supports <i>key recovery</i> in which a signature plus a couple of discriminator bits can
 ; be reversed to find the public key used to calculate it.  This can be convenient when you have a message and a
 ; signature and want to find out who signed it, rather than requiring the user to provide the expected identity.
 ;
 ; This class supports a variety of serialization forms.  The methods that accept/return byte arrays serialize
 ; private keys as raw byte arrays and public keys using the SEC standard byte encoding for public keys.  Signatures
 ; are encoded using ASN.1/DER inside the Bitcoin protocol.
 ;
 ; A key can be <i>compressed</i> or <i>uncompressed</i>.  This refers to whether the public key is represented
 ; when encoded into bytes as an (x, y) coordinate on the elliptic curve, or whether it's represented as just an X
 ; co-ordinate and an extra byte that carries a sign bit.  With the latter form the Y coordinate can be calculated
 ; dynamically, however, <b>because the binary serialization is different the address of a key changes if its
 ; compression status is changed</b>.  If you deviate from the defaults it's important to understand this: money sent
 ; to a compressed version of the key will have a different address to the same key in uncompressed form.  Whether
 ; a public key is compressed or not is recorded in the SEC binary serialisation format, and preserved in a flag in
 ; this class so round-tripping preserves state.  Unless you're working with old software or doing unusual things,
 ; you can usually ignore the compressed/uncompressed distinction.

 ; A data structure that contains proofs of block inclusion for one or more transactions, in an efficient manner.
 ;
 ; The encoding works as follows: we traverse the tree in depth-first order, storing a bit for each traversed node,
 ; signifying whether the node is the parent of at least one matched leaf txid (or a matched txid itself).  In case we
 ; are at the leaf level, or this bit is 0, its merkle node hash is stored, and its children are not explored further.
 ; Otherwise, no hash is stored, but we recurse into both (or the only) child branch.  During decoding, the same
 ; depth-first traversal is performed, consuming bits and hashes as they were written during encoding.
 ;
 ; The serialization is fixed and provides a hard guarantee about the encoded size,
 ; SIZE <= 10 + ceil(32.25 * N) where N represents the number of leaf nodes of the partial tree.
 ; N itself is bounded by:
 ;
 ; N <= total_transactions
 ; N <= 1 + matched_transactions * tree_height
 ;
 ; The serialization format:
 ;  - uint32     total_transactions (4 bytes)
 ;  - varint     number of hashes (1-3 bytes)
 ;  - uint256[]  hashes in depth-first order (<= 32*N bytes)
 ;  - varint     number of bytes of flag bits (1-3 bytes)
 ;  - byte[]     flag bits, packed per 8 in a byte, least significant bit first (<= 2*N-1 bits)

        ;; where that chain is up to or even if the top block we have is even still in the chain - we
        ;; might have got ourselves onto a fork that was later resolved by the network.
        ;;
        ;; To solve this, we send the peer a block locator which is just a list of block hashes.  It contains the
        ;; blocks we know about, but not all of them, just enough of them so the peer can figure out if we did end up
        ;; on a fork and if so, what the earliest still valid block we know about is likely to be.
        ;;
        ;; Once it has decided which blocks we need, it will send us an inv with up to 500 block messages.  We may
        ;; have some of them already if we already have a block chain and just need to catch up.  Once we request the
        ;; last block, if there are still more to come it sends us an "inv" containing only the hash of the head
        ;; block.
        ;;
        ;; That causes us to download the head block but then we find (in processBlock) that we can't connect
        ;; it to the chain yet because we don't have the intermediate blocks.  So we rerun this function building a
        ;; new block locator describing where we're up to.
        ;;
        ;; The getblocks with the new locator gets us another inv with another bunch of blocks.  We download them once
        ;; again.  This time when the peer sends us an inv with the head block, we already have it so we won't download
        ;; it again - but we recognize this case as special and call back into blockChainDownloadLocked to continue the
        ;; process.
        ;;

        ;; in a relatively stateless manner and with constant memory usage.
        ;;
        ;; All this is made more complicated by the desire to skip downloading the bodies of blocks that pre-date the

 ; will be tried after a delay as long as the number of connections less than the maximum.
 ;

 ; will block until peer discovery is completed and some outbound connections have been
 ; initiated (it will return before handshaking is done, however).
 ; You should call {@link PeerGroup#stop()} when finished.  Note that not all methods
 ; of PeerGroup are safe to call from a UI thread as some may do network IO,

 ; A transaction represents the movement of coins from some addresses to some other addresses.  It can also represent
 ; the minting of new coins.  A Transaction object corresponds to the equivalent in the Bitcoin C++ implementation.
 ;
 ; Transactions are the fundamental atoms of Bitcoin and have many powerful features.  Read
 ; <a href="https://bitcoinj.github.io/working-with-transactions">"Working with transactions"</a> in the
 ; documentation to learn more about how to use this class.
 ;
 ; All Bitcoin transactions are at risk of being reversed, though the risk is much less than with traditional payment
 ; systems.  Transactions have <i>confidence levels</i>, which help you decide whether to trust a transaction or not.
 ; Whether to trust a transaction is something that needs to be decided on a case by case basis - a rule that makes
 ; sense for selling MP3s might not make sense for selling cars, or accepting payments from a family member.  If you
 ; are building a wallet, how to present confidence to your users is something to consider carefully.

 ; A TransactionConfidence object tracks data you can use to make a confidence decision about a transaction.
 ; It also contains some pre-canned rules for common scenarios: if you aren't really sure what level of confidence
 ; you need, these should prove useful.  You can get a confidence object using {@link Transaction#getConfidence()}.
 ; They cannot be constructed directly.
 ;
 ; Confidence in a transaction can come in multiple ways:
 ;
 ; <ul>
 ; <li>Because you created it yourself and only you have the necessary keys.</li>
 ; <li>Receiving it from a fully validating peer you know is trustworthy, for instance, because it's run by yourself.</li>
 ; <li>Receiving it from a peer on the network you randomly chose.  If your network connection is not being
 ;     intercepted, you have a pretty good chance of connecting to a node that is following the rules.</li>
 ; <li>Receiving it from multiple peers on the network.  If your network connection is not being intercepted,
 ;     hearing about a transaction from multiple peers indicates the network has accepted the transaction and
 ;     thus miners likely have too (miners have the final say in whether a transaction becomes valid or not).</li>
 ; <li>Seeing the transaction appear appear in a block on the main chain.  Your confidence increases as the transaction
 ;     becomes further buried under work.  Work can be measured either in blocks (roughly, units of time), or
 ;     amount of work done.</li>
 ; </ul>
 ;
 ; Alternatively, you may know that the transaction is "dead", that is, one or more of its inputs have
 ; been double spent and will never confirm unless there is another re-org.
 ;
 ; TransactionConfidence is updated via the {@link TransactionConfidence#incrementDepthInBlocks()}
 ; method to ensure the block depth is up to date.
 ; To make a copy that won't be changed, use {@link TransactionConfidence#duplicate()}.

 ; Utility class that wraps the boilerplate needed to set up a new SPV bitcoinj app.  Instantiate it with a directory
 ; and file prefix, optionally configure a few things, then use startAsync and optionally awaitRunning.  The object will
 ; construct and configure a {@link SPVBlockChain}, {@link SPVBlockStore}, {@link Wallet} and {@link PeerGroup}.  Depending
 ; on the value of the blockingStartup property, startup will be considered complete once the block chain has fully
 ; synchronized, so it can take a while.
 ;
 ; To add listeners and modify the objects that are constructed, you can either do that by overriding the
 ; {@link #onSetupCompleted()} method (which will run on a background thread) and make your changes there,
 ; or by waiting for the service to start and then accessing the objects from wherever you want.  However, you cannot
 ; access the objects this class creates until startup is complete.
 ;
 ; The asynchronous design of this class may seem puzzling (just use {@link #awaitRunning()} if you don't want that).
 ; It is to make it easier to fit bitcoinj into GUI apps, which require a high degree of responsiveness on their main
 ; thread which handles all the animation and user interaction.  Even when blockingStart is false, initializing bitcoinj
 ; means doing potentially blocking file IO, generating keys and other potentially intensive operations.  By running it
 ; on a background thread, there's no risk of accidentally causing UI lag.
 ;
 ; Note that {@link #awaitRunning()} can throw an unchecked {@link IllegalStateException}
 ; if anything goes wrong during startup - you should probably handle it and use {@link Exception#getCause()} to figure
 ; out what went wrong more precisely.  Same thing if you just use the {@link #startAsync()} method.

 ; a single thread only, PeerGroup ensures this by only accessing it from the dedicated PeerGroup thread.  PeerGroup
 ; does not hold any locks whilst this object is used, relying on the single thread to prevent multiple filters being

 ; A deterministic key chain is a {@link KeyChain} that uses the
 ; <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP 32 standard</a>, as implemented by
 ; {@link DeterministicHierarchy}, to derive all the keys in the keychain from a master seed.
 ; This type of wallet is extremely convenient and flexible.  Although backing up full wallet files is always a good
 ; idea, to recover money only the root seed needs to be preserved and that is a number small enough that it can be
 ; written down on paper or, when represented using a BIP 39 {@link MnemonicCode},
 ; dictated over the phone (possibly even memorized).
 ;
 ; Deterministic key chains have other advantages: parts of the key tree can be selectively revealed to allow
 ; for auditing, and new public keys can be generated without access to the private keys, yielding a highly secure
 ; configuration for web servers which can accept payments into a wallet but not spend from them.  This does not work
 ; quite how you would expect due to a quirk of elliptic curve mathematics and the techniques used to deal with it.
 ; A watching wallet is not instantiated using the public part of the master key as you may imagine.  Instead, you
 ; need to take the account key (first child of the master key) and provide the public part of that to the watching
 ; wallet instead.  You can do this by calling {@link #getWatchingKey()} and then serializing it with
 ; {@link DeterministicKey#serializePubB58(Ledger)}.  The resulting "xpub..." string encodes sufficient information
 ; about the account key to create a watching chain via
 ; {@link DeterministicKey#deserializeB58(DeterministicKey, String, Ledger)}
 ; (with null as the first parameter) and then
 ; {@link DeterministicKeyChain#DeterministicKeyChain(DeterministicKey)}.
 ;
 ; This class builds on {@link DeterministicHierarchy} and {@link DeterministicKey}
 ; by adding support for serialization to and from protobufs, and encryption of parts of the key tree.  Internally it
 ; arranges itself as per the BIP 32 spec, with the seed being used to derive a master key, which is then used to derive
 ; an account key, the account key is used to derive two child keys called the <i>internal</i> and <i>external</i> parent
 ; keys (for change and handing out addresses respectively) and finally the actual leaf keys that users use hanging off
 ; the end.  The leaf keys are special in that they don't internally store the private part at all, instead choosing to
 ; rederive the private key from the parent when needed for signing.  This simplifies the design for encrypted key chains.
 ;
 ; The key chain manages a <i>lookahead zone</i>.  This zone is required because when scanning the chain, you don't
 ; know exactly which keys might receive payments.  The user may have handed out several addresses and received payments
 ; on them, but for latency reasons the block chain is requested from remote peers in bulk, meaning you must
 ; "look ahead" when calculating keys to put in the Bloom filter.  The default lookahead zone is 100 keys, meaning
 ; if the user hands out more than 100 addresses and receives payment on them before the chain is next scanned, some
 ; transactions might be missed.  100 is a reasonable choice for consumer wallets running on CPU constrained devices.
 ; For industrial wallets that are receiving keys all the time, a higher value is more appropriate.  Ideally DKC and
 ; the wallet would know how to adjust this value automatically, but that's not implemented at the moment.
 ;
 ; In fact the real size of the lookahead zone is larger than requested, by default, it's one third larger.  This
 ; is because the act of deriving new keys means recalculating the Bloom filters and this is an expensive operation.
 ; Thus, to ensure we don't have to recalculate on every single new key/address requested or seen we add more buffer
 ; space and only extend the lookahead zone when that buffer is exhausted.  For example with a lookahead zone of 100
 ; keys, you can request 33 keys before more keys will be calculated and the Bloom filter rebuilt and rebroadcast.
 ; But even when you are requesting the 33rd key, you will still be looking 100 keys ahead.

 ; A KeyChainGroup is used by the {@link Wallet} and manages: a {@link BasicKeyChain} object
 ; (which will normally be empty), and zero or more {@link DeterministicKeyChain}s.  A deterministic key chain will be
 ; created lazily/on demand when a fresh or current key is requested, possibly being initialized from the private key
 ; bytes of the earliest non rotating key in the basic key chain if one is available, or from a fresh random seed if not.
 ;
 ; If a key rotation time is set, it may be necessary to add a new DeterministicKeyChain with a fresh seed and

 ; one deterministic chain.  The latest chain is called the active chain and is where new keys are served from.
 ;
 ; The wallet delegates most key management tasks to this class.  It is <b>not</b> thread safe and requires external
 ; locking, i.e. by the wallet lock.  The group then in turn delegates most operations to the key chain objects,
 ; combining their responses together when necessary.
 ;

;; To do list:
;;
;; - Take all wallet-relevant data out of Transaction and put it into WalletTransaction.  Make Transaction immutable.
;; - Only store relevant transaction outputs, don't bother storing the rest of the data.  Big RAM saving.
;; - Split block chain and tx output tracking into a superclass that doesn't have any key or spending related code.
;; - Simplify how transactions are tracked and stored: in particular, have the wallet maintain positioning information
;;   for transactions independent of the transactions themselves, so the timeline can be walked without having to
;;   process and sort every single transaction.
;; - Split data persistence out into a backend class and make the wallet transactional, so we can store a wallet
;;   in a database not just in RAM.
;; - Make clearing of transactions able to only rewind the wallet a certain distance instead of all blocks.
;; - Make it scale:
;;     - eliminate all the algorithms with quadratic complexity (or worse).
;;     - don't require everything to be held in RAM at once.
;;     - consider allowing eviction of no longer re-orgable transactions or keys that were used up.
;;
;; Finally, find more ways to break the class up and decompose it.  Currently every time we move code out, other code
;; fills up the lines saved!

 ; A Wallet stores keys and a record of transactions that send and receive value from those keys.  Using these,

 ; To learn more about this class, read <a href="https://bitcoinj.github.io/working-with-the-wallet">working with the wallet</a>.
 ;
 ; To fill up a Wallet with transactions, you need to use it in combination with a {@link SPVBlockChain} and various

 ; on the website to learn more about how to set everything up.

 ; Wallets can be serialized using protocol buffers.  You need to save the wallet whenever it changes, there is an
 ; auto-save feature that simplifies this for you although you're still responsible for manually triggering a save when
 ; your app is about to quit because the auto-save feature waits a moment before actually committing to disk to avoid IO
 ; thrashing when the wallet is changing very fast (e.g. due to a block chain sync).
